# TVM

##  Crypto / Pwn - 400

Who needs a physical TPM when you can emulate one! The brand new TVM is a fully custom TPM that runs entirely in software.

We found some documentation about the TVM architechture, but when we looked for the source code all we found was one header file.

NOTE: The goal is NOT to get a shell
